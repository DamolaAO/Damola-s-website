        <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are countless benefits of IT tools and systems used for efficiency and productivity, for example, sending an email to someone is more efficient and productive than going to meet 
            a person that could live hours away and talking face to face every time a specific bit of information is needed to be said. However on the other end of that there are draw backs like, if a conversation is happening
            and a lot of questions are needed to be asked, it could take much longer waiting for and sending emails back and forth than a online time conversation. The lack of expession that can be
            conveyed through messages can also lead to misunderstandings and lead to relationships between two people to become volatile, which reduces efficiency. Another IT tool and system
            are things like social networking while doing work. Benefits of this include things like asking for help from a community on things like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack overflow</a> as these
            you can get a lot of opinions and possible solutions from a bunch of people that might have more experience and knowledge than you. With these types of sites you can easily upload your work
            and try get specific answers that you might never find looking online. A drawback of this is that it is easy to get distracted by othere's things and lose focus of where you are at which can
            greatly stump productivity. Websites like Trello have lots of benefits to efficiency when it comes to planning , however with the lack of communication ability on there, it is easy for two
            people to accidently start the same thing which wastes a lot of time.

        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The ways to imporve productivity and efficiency are dependant on what you are doing. When it comes to coding in something like HTML or Pyhton, learning the different shortcuts on the keyboard 
            and using tab to complete different words and such is a good way to increase efficiency when coding. The same goes for just doing somethign as simple as learing how to type faster on a keyboard.
            Making sure that all your files are organized so time isn't wasted looking around for the specific files you wish to open is a good, yet simple, way to increase efficiency and productivity.
            Something like making the files sorted into alphabetical order or just grouping relevant files withing sub folders. For example, if creating a game with two parts, have all the files releated to
            the first part in one folder, and all the other part in another. Anoher small one is to take regular breaks, people who take regular breaks will have more drive to continue than someone that
            works for giant periods at a time. A lot about increasing productivity can be to do with your mentallity and attitude towards working, taking regualr breaks will refresh your mentallity and allow
            you to push further.

        <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            For the next project I work on, I will make sure to work on all the small things such as, learning more of the shortcuts and increasing the output of words I can type in a time. I would also
            prefer to work in a team that was the workload can be cut down many times over which would also increase my mentallity and attitude towards the project. This would also allow me to get
            feedback as well as help quicker from peers which would further push the work. A team will also mean that more ideas get introduced into the planning phase so that everything can be accounted
            for in the start, as opposed to having to go back and change things as much. I would also spread out my workload so that I take more shorter breaks rather than working for many hours at a time
            and then going the next day without doing any work at all.

        <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Throughout my work there has been a few spelling errors that I ended up correcting just by simply reading back through it. There are many programs that will actualy read through your work
            and either let you know about errors or just fix them for you. Things such as Visual Code have built-in systems that let you know where are what type of error there is when dealing with coding
            languages such as Pyhton. Every time a new part of the project is added, the coder should always test it right after as adding stuff can sometimes be the reason other parts stop working.
            Resources such as Github allow for users to create repositories as well as update them with more recent updates. If allowed to be accessed publically/posted, people of the community can
            inform you of mistakes that are causing errors.
