        <h2>1.1: Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The amount of uses in modern businesses is so vast that it is hard to imagine that any business hasn't benefited from it. From farmers being able to keep production records 
            to google's supercomputer, IT's purpose is convenience and innovation. Online shopping is one result of innovation from IT and is one of the best things for businesses 
            as it benefits both the business and customer, as well as the ability to target a global audience. Online shopping is more efficient than shopping in a store and also 
            allows people with mental health issues such as claustrophobia and anxiety, which can make it hard for people to be a place with a large gathering of people. 
            IT also allows bussinesses to market and network online much easier and cheaper than television/radio and newspaper advertisement, which again, allows them to target more 
            people. Cloud computing/storage is another amazing part of IT that greatly favours business as it allows for them to sefely keep backups of data they need incase of 
            emergency and in case of small business, is more efficeint than a private computer network. In the case of a pandemic, such as COVID 19 that we are going through right 
            now, IT has allowed businesses to stay connected with their staff and lets them to continue to work from home. IT is the reason that many business haven't gone under 
            at a time like this.

        <h2>1.2: Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfuly.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            If the digital project is to market something, the use of a web page is a good method of presenting information to an audience as the information is available immediately 
            and from anyway as long as they have access to the internet at that time. Web pages can also be accessed from almost anywhere in the world too, so this means the information 
            can reach a wider audience too. Web pages can also be linked and contain links so it can be shared around or be used on other web pages. Creating a successful web page will 
            require skills, such as, the ability to code in HTML and use of CSS. For a more professional web page, skills with graphics design, or just basic design knowledge, as well as 
            understanding how to prevent security attacks. For any digital project to be successful, the people working on it will have to be able to keep track of each others work, and 
            their own deadlines. This can be accomplished with resources such as <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a>, which is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual studio code</a>, which 
            would allow the use of HTML and CSS, and something as simple as google which can be used for research and collecting images.

        <h2>1.3: Plan and carry out tasks using IT.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            A great way to plan and keep track of tasks is to use <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a>. We used trello in the projct with the game and I will be using it to plan and carry out this project too. 
            My trello board for this project can be accessed by clicking <a href = "https://trello.com/b/dwD6J31k/my-website">here</a>. There a many advantages of resources like trello, one is that, if the project is a group thing, each person can 
            see what the others have done, what they are doing, and what needs to be done. Deadlines can easliy be kept track of as you can assign deadlines for each specific task of the 
            project, which will make the project flow smoothly as work can be left and then go back to towards the end. Another advantage is that it can be accessed from a mobile phone, 
            so if you are out and you have an idea of what can be added or changed, as long as you have access to it, it can be added quickly. On the other hand, although users can post comments 
            on the back of the cards, it is not the smoothest when it comes to communicationg. Even though this can be worked around with other apps/sites, it would be useful if it included 
            some kind of messaging board, as using zoom or switching to different apps/sites just to get a faster response can be troublesome.
        </p>

        <h2>1.4: Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are a lot of risks that can affect an online project, and depending on the kind of hardware/software needed, more risks are greater than others. For example, if a company uses a 
            server, the company will have to make sure they have a backup server somewhere off campus or secure back up of all the data to the cloud. This is because of disasters such as fires 
            and floods could destroy the servers and lose all the data, this is more likely to affect a company with a server trather than someone with a say a laptop. When planning a project, there are 
            risks that can happane that we are aware could be a problem, and risks that we are not aware of. Over optimism is a very simple risk that everyone should be aware of and should take into 
            account. Being over optimistic can lead to the project missing deadlines because the team bit off more than they could chew. There are costs risks that can impact a digital project 
            and can be caused in many different ways. One example would be errors in a design plan. This could cause the project to give unexpected outcomes, which means more time is going to have 
            to be spent fixing the code, in which the employees are going to have to be paid for their time. Another risk would be the loss of the data. This can be caused by a number of things, 
            including an unstable internet connection or malware attacks. Precuations like backing up to seperate computers/server or the cloud storage, as well as training the employees with how to deal 
            with unexpected emails and usb sticks. Copyright issues are also a risk to a digital project, but can be easliy avoided by using non-copyrighted resources and asking for permission from the creators. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1.5: Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are many different IT softwares and systems that can be used, however it all depends on what the project is. For my web page project, I use a desktop computer with the use of 
            Visual Studio Code. In visual studio code I can then use HTML5 to put all the information and links onto the web page, and CSS to make it look more appealing. I used HTML5 as it 
            is a more refined version of HTML and it greatly simplifies the process of making the web page. My web page isn't going to have anything complicated in it, so the use of a backend 
            software such as python or Jave Script. I will also use google along with photoshop to allow the use of customised/original images to be added the web page to mkae it more visually pleasing. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>1.6: Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the creation of my web page, I used HTML5, CSS, google and trello. HTML5 allowed me to put all the text and images onto the actual page as well as structure the information in the way I 
            like. It has also allowed the use of hyperlinks, which is useful as it allows me to link resources without having to display full links that look out of place. Trello has everything I needed to organize 
            the project on my own. It allowed me to create different checklists so i can easliy remind myself what I have done and what needs to be done. I could also add comments to each card in 
            list to specify exactly what I want to become of that part, incase I forgot at a later point. Also whenever I had an idea when I wasn't at my PC, I eould use my phone to add it to trello. 
            Github will allow me to version control my code, so that I can identify and fix problems with the code of my website more easily. I can do this as every time I create a bit of the website that 
            works, I can add it to github and if something goes wrong with the next bits, I can go back and compare to see what could have happened. 
        </p>

        <h2>1.7: Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            When creating a digital project, there are legal guidelines from the <a href = "https://gdpr.eu/" target = "_blank">GDPR</a> that are strict and must be followed. Depending on what the digital project is, different guidleines apply to it. 
            For example, if the project is something that takes information from customers and stores it, it is that team's/businesses' job to ensure that the information of the customers 
            are secure and well protected. If the databases get hacked and the information of the customners are leaked, the business/team will be held accountable for not being secure enough. 
            Copyright laws are a big constraint when working on a digital project. Copyright infringement is a big issue of the digital world, but can easlily be avoided. To ensure that 
            a team is not infringing on the Copyright laws, they must use non-copyrighted resources or ask for permission from the creators if you really want to use it. In my web page, I 
            made sure to use only non-copyrighted images and linkiing to resources. The GDPR can affect a project in many ways and more can be learned by visiting the official website <a href = "https://gdpr.eu/" target = "_blank">here</a>
