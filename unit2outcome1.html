        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page .</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            The index page of my website is an about me page. It starts with a welcome message to the website and a sub heading saying "About me". There is a small paragraph under the sub
            heading telling the viewer a little about me. Under that are my interests in technology and coding in a small paragraph under a sub heading. Under that is a small explination as
            to why I joined code nation and what my future goal is, images have also been included when talking about something specific. Because gaming is a big part of my life, I wanted to 
            include a part that just talks about some of my favourite games as they have been with me a while. All of the unit outcomes are formatted the same, with a sub heading containing the 
            question and a paragraph under with my answer. Every page has the navigation bar fixed to the top so that you don't have scroll back to the top just to go to the next page. 
            The background image is also in a fixed position as it creates a nice scrolling effect with the text. The final page is a contact information page that contains information on ways
            to get intouch with me.

        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            When creating a website, you must be careful to not infringe on anyones rights. Copyright is the exclusive and assignable legal right, given to the originator for a fixed number of years, 
            to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material. This resticts what you are able to publish on a website and is one of the main constraints that affect
            websites. A good way to get around this is by asking for permission and linking references on your own site. Another constraint is that website may not look quite right or how you wish on 
            other devices such as, mobile, or a large tvt/monitor. There are usually many limited mobile optimization when designing a website fit for a phone. Although there are options such as Flex
            that can be implemented into the CSS of a website to allow it to transition to different resolutions, the translation isn't always as smooth as one would like it.

        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            If a website is designed in one way, no matter how popular it is, they are cutting out part of a potential audience for their work. If the web pages have a font that is too small
            or hard to read, people with vision impairment won't be able to read it properly. Similarly with people who are fully blind, a web designer should take into account the possiblilities
            and include programs that can output audio that will tell a blind person what is said and a description of images. Again, with colour blind people, make sure that the text is a colour
            that is clearly distiguishable from the background it's on to make it easy to read, as well as links. People who may not have access to computers and only a mobile device may also have
            trouble accessing the information on the website if making the web page transitionable to different resolutions isn't taken into account.

        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are a number of open standard file types related to the web, includng HTML, .txt, .pdf, .jpg, .png, .mp3, .svg and .mp4. A .txt file is a standard text document that holds unformatted
            text. It is recognised and can be opened with any text or word processing software such as Microsoft word or Notepad. A .pdf file is a file that holds a document in a format. It is used
            to save files that cannot be modified but still needed to b read or printed out, software that can read pdf files are needed to open it such as Adobe reader. A .jpg file is a file that
            cointains and can display images and are perfect for websites to be able to add images to them. A .png file is similar to a .jpg with the fact it contains an image and can be displayed, however
            it is a open format with no copyright limitations and has the ability to display transparent backgrounds. This is great for when you wish to have a image on a website but don't want a white
            background, making the image look ugly and out of place. .mp3 is a sound file and can be useful on websites when just sound is wanting to be played. For example, a podcast or song snippet
            may be wanted on the website as a video is not accompanied by it. An .mp4 file on the other hand is a video and sound file that can be displayed and played live on the website. More can be found
