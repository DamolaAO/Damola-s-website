            <br>I grew up in manchester with an older brother and younger sister. I am half Nigerian, so I also grew up with more than
            one culture.<br>I am currently apart of the Code Nation online course where I am learning how to code in python and HTML.

        <h2>Interests in technology and coding</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have grown up playing and watching all kinds of video games. my interests in technology and coding mainly stem from game.
            <br>The front end as well as the back end of games facinate me I would love to be able to work on a successful game at some point.
            I believe that my career in life should be<br>to do with something I have always loved.

        <h2>Why I joined Code Nation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I have done computer science at both secondary school and college, however the GCSE computer science was take away in the last year
            <br>and I dropped out of college a few months before sitting the exams. I joined Code Nation as it was soemthing brought to me that
            <br>gives me the chance to catch up and learn some other things while getting actual qualifications. It's an opportunity.

    <div><h1>My favourite games</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Call of Duty</h2>
        <p>I have grown up playing the call of duty games from a very young age. It is the first multiplayer game I ever played and always 
            <br>got the new one every year. I made most of my close friends from school but we spent most of the time playing 
            <br>call fo duty together. My favourite part of the games is the zombies mode that was introduced in <b>Call of duty: World at war</b>
            <br>back in 2008. It is the main reason I buy the new games. My favourite multiplayer call of duty is <b>Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2</b> 
            <br>and <b>Call of duty: Black Ops 2</b> as they are the games I have the best memories on and could still go back and play it till this day.

        <h2>Destiny</h2>
        <p>
            Destiny was my favourite game for years, the grinding aspect of the PVE (Player vs Environment), which was translatable to the FPS (First person shooter)
            <br>Multiplayer part was bliss to me. The constant extention with the new guns and armour to grind for through strikes and raids, as well as the pvp
            <br>itself. The raids were probably the most exciting part of the game when I new one came out, having to figure out the different mechanics to take down
            <br>the bosses and puzzles was always entertaining. The Trails of Osiris was a PvP (Player vs Player) mode that made me and my friends the most hype
            <br>as it was always competetive. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h2>League of Legends</h2>
        <p>
            An online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game that has been one of the most popular PC games for a long time. Everyone that plays the game, including me,
            <br>has a love hate relationship with it. It isn't my favourite game by far, however it is a fun game to play with friends and has been the game I play most
            <br>recently. My favourite champions are Pyke and Yasuo.
