            When creating my web page, the use of Visual Code has been great. Being able to use HTML and CSS within the same program makes going back and forth easy and quick. HTML5 has also 
            made the HTML side of the web page very simple and pleasent to use. Things such as creating the navigation bar using links takes no time because of how easy it is to grasp and then
            apply. When creating my navigation bar, at first it was just a simple string of links at the top of the screen with no spaces, however after learning a bit more and applying CSS to
            it, I was able to customise it. I was able to add a background bar, change the different colours of the links, add spacing and change the alignment. Also before using CSS, the
            images included, even the backgorund, were the wrong size and would move with the screen. CSS allowed for me position and resize to exactly what I wanted with precision. Trello has
            also allowed me to log any things that I wished to change about my page so that when I looked back at it, the thought wouldn't be lost. For example, a bit after creating the navigation
            bar and getting off my computer, I thought about making the navigation bar's position scroll with the page, so I added it to the trello board and added it in the next time round.

            Visual Code is a source-code editor which fits the purpose of which I need it. I used Visual Code to be able to use HTML5 and CSS, and it did allow me to do so easily. A pro of Visual
            Studio Code is the code coloring along with the customizable themes. This allows the code to be a lot clearer to read through as it changes the different functions and methods to different
            colours so they are easier to identify. Another pro is the amount of the built in plugins/extensions it comes with that makes the quality of life about the program to be user friendly.
            A third pro is that the software's memory consuption is low, therefore even with a computer/laptop that isn't the best or doesn't have the most memory can run it decently quick and is 
            incredibly smooth to run. A con of Visual Studio Code is that the errors with certain languages don't display in a way that makes them easy to identify. For example, in Python, a sytax
            error in the terminal will take you to the line bellow or the start of a function if say a bracket or colon is missing at the end of a line.

            Trello is a website that allows for it's users to keep track of a project with categories such as, to do, doing and done, however the user can add more categories if they wish. This website
            fit perfectly for my purpose of planning this web page for a number of reason. A pro of Trello is it's simplicity, this made it easy to use and understand everything that was added after looking
            back at it. Another pro is it is mobile friendly. Whenever coming up with a new idea for your plan when you aren't at your computer/laptop, your mobile phone can be used to access
            Trello on the fly so that any idea you have won't be forggoten. A con of Trello is that only simple descriptions can be given to each card, so if you wanted something very specific, you 
            wouldn't be able to type it all out. You can find more reviews on Trello <a href = "https://www.trustradius.com/products/trello/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons" target = "_blank">here</a>.

        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            My final work is at a place that I like. I like the clean, organized, monochrome type look to a web page as opposed to a bright and loud layout. I believe the main strength of my work is 
            that it is clean and easy to read all the information on it and navigate through. Another strength of my final work from feedback of others is the consistency of the layout. This makes
            it more pleasing to read through the page, rather than looking all over the place, scrolling up and down for different information. Another strength of my final work is the use of hyper-links
            making it clear where the user should click to be taken to the relvant page in a new tab so that that web page stays open. A weakness of my final work is the lack of complexity, for example
            a drop-down list for the navigation bar, or different backgorunds with different sections of the page. A weakness I have been told is the lack of colours, however this part is subjective
            so while that person thought of it as a weakness, I thought of it as a strength. This did however make me think of oh to settle the differences, like with more images maybe.

        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            For my web page I could improve the navigation bar to maybe hideable or as a drop down so that the screen space can be clearer. This would be an improvement as there may be some
            visitors to prefer it that way and allow them to do so if they please. My web page could also be improved by including a little more on the about me page. This is because this page is
            supposed to represent me and it may present me as a boring person because it is formatted cleanly like the rest of my pages. I could also create and add a original logo to top of the
            top of the page to again represent myself a little more while also making it look more professional.

        <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            When creating my web page I made sure to stick to the plan I made as best as I could. There were some instances in which I could not fulfil as it was too compleicated/ would take
            too much time to implement for the current level of web design I am at. It could have involved the use of backend languages to achieve but was not something that would be done at my
            level. Also when creating the web page I would change things around to ensure they matched the requirements so that it can be called a success. With the feedback I got from other
            people, I was able to make it so the website more closely met the requires of the work than when I just used my own opinions and knowledge. All the feedback I was given was added to my
            Trello board so that I could refer to it and make sure it was added if needed to be.
